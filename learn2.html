        <p>Vision impairment refers to people who are blind or who have partial vision.

When talking with a person who is blind or has a vision impairment:

always identify yourself and any others with you
ask if the person requires assistance, and listen for specific instructions, however be prepared for your offer to be refused.
If guiding a person, let them take your arm, rather than taking theirs. Describe any changes in the environment such as steps, obstacles, etc.

If the person has a guide dog, please remember the dog is working and should not be patted, fed or distracted.</p>
      <h2 id="symptoms">Deaf or hard of Hearing</h2>
        <p>Hearing impairments can range from mild to profound. People who are hard of hearing may use a range of strategies and equipment including speech, lip-reading, writing notes, hearing aids or sign language interpreters.

When talking to a person who is deaf or hard of hearing:

look and speak directly to them, not just to the people accompanying them, including interpreters
speak clearly and use a normal tone of voice unless otherwise instructed by the person with the hearing impairment

be considerate of the extra time it might take for a person with an intellectual disability to do or say something
be patient and give your undivided attention, especially with someone who speaks slowly or with great effort.</p>
