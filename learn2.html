      <h2 id="definition">Vision Impairment</h2>
        <p>Vision impairment refers to people who are blind or who have partial vision.

When talking with a person who is blind or has a vision impairment:

always identify yourself and any others with you
ask if the person requires assistance, and listen for specific instructions, however be prepared for your offer to be refused.
If guiding a person, let them take your arm, rather than taking theirs. Describe any changes in the environment such as steps, obstacles, etc.

If the person has a guide dog, please remember the dog is working and should not be patted, fed or distracted.</p>
      <h2 id="symptoms">Deaf or Hard of Hearing</h2>
        <p>Hearing impairments can range from mild to profound. People who are hard of hearing may use a range of strategies and equipment including speech, lip-reading, writing notes, hearing aids or sign language interpreters.

When talking to a person who is deaf or hard of hearing:

look and speak directly to them, not just to the people accompanying them, including interpreters
speak clearly and use a normal tone of voice unless otherwise instructed by the person with the hearing impairment
if you don't understand what a person is saying, ask them to repeat or rephrase, or alternatively offer them a pen and paper.</p>
      <h2 id="progress">Mental Health Conditions</h2>
        <p>Mental illness is a general term for a group of illnesses that affect the mind or brain. These illnesses, which include bipolar disorder, depression, schizophrenia, anxiety and personality disorders, affect the way a person thinks, feels and acts.
A person with a mental health condition may experience difficulty concentrating, which can sometimes be a result of medication. Try to avoid overly stressful situations wherever possible so that their condition is not exacerbated.</p>
      <h2 id="cause">Intellectual Disability</h2>
        <p>A person with an intellectual disability may have significant limitations in the skills needed to live and work in the community, including difficulties with communication, self-care, social skills, safety and self-direction.

The most important thing to remember is to treat each person as an individual:

a person with an intellectual disability is just like everyone else - treat them as you would like to be treated
be considerate of the extra time it might take for a person with an intellectual disability to do or say something
be patient and give your undivided attention, especially with someone who speaks slowly or with great effort.</p>
      <h2 id="cure">Physical Disability</h2>
        <p>he common characteristic in physical disability is that some aspect of a person's physical functioning, usually either their mobility, dexterity, or stamina, is affected. People with physical disability are usually experts in their own needs, and will understand the impact of their disability.

There are many different kinds of disability and a wide variety of situations people experience. The disability may be permanent or temporary. It may exist from birth or be acquired later in life. People with the same disability are as likely as anyone else to have different abilities. </p>
